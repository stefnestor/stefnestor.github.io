title: "[LAB] Append Console Research to Report via Bash"
---

**GOAL**: Forward console research (command and output) into notes to 
reduce report write-up time.

## A - Lab

### 1. code

Note: This is more complex than your normal google results of "add output 
to file" because we want to also capture the generating command.

Preferably, you'll add the following into your `.bash_profile` or bash 
dotfiles to be able to access this `append` command from any session.

```bash
### to use
# 1. execute random command
# 2. run: append "!!"
#    - will capture very last within session
#    - !! must be in quotes to parse bash pipes, etc
#
function append {
  if [[ -z $NOTE ]]; then
    echo "ðŸ‘» not saved; set NOTE & repeat"
  else
    input="$*"
    FILEa='/Users/stef/downloads'/$NOTE'.md'

    echo >> $FILEa
    echo "\`\`\`" >> $FILEa
    echo "$ #" $(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S) >> $FILEa
    echo "$ "$input >> $FILEa
    echo "$(eval $input)" >> $FILEa
    echo "\`\`\`" >> $FILEa
  fi
}
```

This is purposely written to respect Bash piping (allows you to use `jq`, 
`grep`, etc).

### 2. run

If you added to dotfiles, you can run `append` from any console Bash 
session/directory. (May require restarting your console.)

```bash
Last login: Mon Jun 27 11:59:23 on ttys000
$ pwd
/Users/stef/Documents
$
$ NOTE="TMP"
$ echo "stef"
stef
$ append "!!"
append "echo "stef""
$
$ cd /Users/stef/Downloads
$ ls | grep TMP
TMP.md
```

### 3. result

The `TMP.md` (file was auto-created-as-needed and) appended
`````````
```
$ # 20220627-120212
$ echo stef
stef
```
`````````

As a Mardown file, this will render

> ```
> $ # 20220627-120212
> $ echo stef
> stef
> ```

## B - Use Case

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for my notes which lets you wiki 
embed sub-Markdown-pages. I work on Elasticsearch Database Administration.

[Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co) lets 
you maintain your "deployment" via 
[their API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-restful-api.html). 
You can also capture a point-in-time cluster view via an Elasticsearch 
[diagnostic](https://github.com/elastic/support-diagnostics#usage-examples).

### 1. ess api

You can setup your Bash dotfiles to quick cURL your ESS/ECE deployment's 
[ES API Console](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-api-console.html).

```bash
### to use
# 1. setup console variable: ELASTIC_ECE_KEY
# 2. run ess $DEPLOYMENT_ID $REQUEST_PATH
#
function ess {
  AUTH="Authorization: APIKey ${ELASTIC_ECE_KEY}"
  MGMNT="X-Management-Request: true"
  DOMAIN="https://adminconsole.found.no/api/v1/deployments/$1/elasticsearch/"
  optA="main-elasticsearch/"
  optB="elasticsearch/"
  URI_END="proxy/"

  if [[ -z "$2" ]]; then URI="/"; else URI=$2; fi
  if [[ URI != "/" ]]; then URI_END+=$2; fi
  response=$(curl -s -XGET -H "$AUTH" -H "$MGMNT" $DOMAIN$optA$URI_END)

  if [[ $response == *"resource_not_found"* ]]; then
    response=$(curl -s -XGET -H "$AUTH" -H "$MGMNT" $DOMAIN$optB$URI_END)
  fi
  echo $response
}
```

Your simplified deployment's Elasticsearch cURL can now be ran in 
console, e.g.

```bash
$ ess e406cfd66dc944119bd8da2bb7290d2b _cluster/health?filter_path=status
{"status":"yellow"}
```

### 2. investigate

Let's say I've received an alert that my cluster's `status:yellow`. 
JSON filtering done via [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual). I'll 
grab a diagnostic to capture my point-in-time situation. Then confirm:

```bash
$ NOTE="my_report"
$ where
/Users/stef/downloads/diag
$ append "!!"
$ cat cluster_health.json | jq '.status'
"yellow"
```

My [Allocation Cheatsheet](https://github.com/stefnestor/elastic/blob/main/Elasticsearch/Index/Shard/Allocation/allocation%20cheatsheet.pdf) 
suggests we need to check if we're currently assigning/recovering shards.

```bash
$ cat cluster_health.json | jq '{status,number_of_nodes,active_shards,unassigned_shards,active_shards_percent_as_number,relocating_shards,initializing_shards,delayed_unassigned_shards}'
{
  "status": "yellow",
  "number_of_nodes": 2,
  "active_shards": 92,
  "unassigned_shards": 3,
  "active_shards_percent_as_number": 96.84210526315789,
  "relocating_shards": 0,
  "initializing_shards": 0,
  "delayed_unassigned_shards": 0
}
$ append "!!"
```

We are not, so following cheatsheet, we'll kick off a 
[Cluster Reroute](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-reroute.html). 
After 5min, I run `ess` to poll 
[Cluster Health](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-health.html).

```bash
$ ess e406cfd66dc944119bd8da2bb7290d2b _cluster/health | jq '{status,number_of_nodes,active_shards,unassigned_shards,active_shards_percent_as_number,relocating_shards,initializing_shards,delayed_unassigned_shards}'
{
  "status": "yellow",
  "number_of_nodes": 2,
  "active_shards": 92,
  "unassigned_shards": 3,
  "active_shards_percent_as_number": 96.84210526315789,
  "relocating_shards": 0,
  "initializing_shards": 0,
  "delayed_unassigned_shards": 0
}
$ append "!!"
```

We're unchanged. This suggests a non-transient issue's at play. We 
continue to use the cheatsheet and 
[Elasticsearch docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started.html) 
to investigate.

Where Elasticsearch's recovery and ILM processes can poll at <10min 
intervals, I frequently work with clients on transient issues. This is 
why my research=>report integration automatically tracks the time added.

For internal tracking, I usually leave the file in its raw format:

![raw report](/images/2022-06-27-bash-append-research-to-report-A.png)

### 3. result

If a client is requesting an RCA, I'll manually add in quotes 
(previously written notes summarizing various Elastic concepts) to flush 
out the why/how we progressed through our investigation:

![report with annotations](/images/2022-06-27-bash-append-research-to-report-B.png)

This exports as a ready-to-go PDF.

![frontend report](/images/2022-06-27-bash-append-research-to-report-C.png)

Note: For an actual RCA, I'll write-up an executive abstract at the top 
and flush out the stream-of-concious investigation below. The second 
part's not required but helps me teach my clients to reduce their 
dependency on me.

## C - Review

Happy so far. Future wants:

- [LNAV](http://lnav.org) (console log viewer) allows you to filter columns and not just rows which'd be very helpful for reports.
- Obsidian's [Local Rest API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) let's you API query your notes which'd be helpful to automate diagnostic/log investigation to known issues.
  - You can use Python + Obsidian's [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) to transition visual diagrams into investigation paths.
