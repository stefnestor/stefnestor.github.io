      <description>Python functions to convert (Elastic) bytes/timing units to human readable format.&#xA;Human API flag Elasticsearch&amp;rsquo;s API offers multiple performance statistics for bytes/timing that can have human readable, sister-columns emitted via ?human API flag.&#xA;This human view can be very helpful on interpretting e.g. Node Stats, Index Stats, Repository Metering, Index Recovery, Node Tasks, and ILM Explain.&#xA;However, sometimes we need a middle-step calculation to make these emitted stats more usable/interpretable.</description>
